# Catppuccin for Discord

Welcome to Port of Catppuccin for Discord! This theme is part of my Hack Club project and features the beautiful Mocha variant of the Catppuccin color scheme.

Funnily enough, this was harder than my pink theme, even though it looks soo much easier (too many variables)

## Acknowledgements

- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) for the beautiful color palette.
- [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) for the inspiration for me to code in the first place.
- [Catppuccin-Discord] (https://github.com/catppuccin/discord) I really liked these ports, but everything was    good (except) the mocha one, i felt like I could make it better, also most code was inspired from this!

Enjoy your new Discord theme!
I may make more in the future
