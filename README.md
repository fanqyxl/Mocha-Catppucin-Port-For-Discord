## Acknowledgements

- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) for the beautiful color palette.
- [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) for the inspiration for me to code in the first place.
- [Catppuccin-Discord] (https://github.com/catppuccin/discord) I really liked these ports, but everything was    good (except) the mocha one, i felt like I could make it better, also most code was inspired from this!

Enjoy your new Discord theme!
I may make more in the future
